This is my first React project. (The reference I relied on: https://github.com/aleksanderlamkov/todo-react/tree/53f25f86cd008bc8ad84edc1af5a7386b223188b ). In this project, I used Zustand, json-server, and TanStack Router.

Please note that I am actively using the Gemini Code Assist extension for VS Code. It provides excellent suggestions and cuts my coding time in half. Because of this, you might notice some inconsistency with semicolons (some lines have them, others don't) — I apologize for that in advance.

I also invite you to take a look at the commit history, as you might find it interesting.

Important Note: According to my learning roadmap, I haven't reached the Git module yet. I started using it before fully studying it, so please don't judge the Git workflow too strictly.
